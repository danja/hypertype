Motivated by wanting a nice & clear, but distinctive fonts for my sites. Starting with body text (Used to use Georgia, currently Merriweather on WordPress).

Modern-looking but retaining some of Times-like authority.

Legibility/readability a priority, so nothing too radical.

Started with Liberation Serif 2, to get Times New Roman metrics.
