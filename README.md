Playing with a custom typeface...

Using birdfont, by eye (maybe use fontforge later to standardise measurements).

Quick first pass: reducing/softening serifs, making ties like Burlingame. Doesn't matter if they're messy (take time over individual chars to fix later).

*Progress* : ABCDEFGHIJK

Motivated by wanting a nice & clear, but distinctive fonts for my sites. Serif body text first. (Used to use Georgia, currently Merriweather on WordPress).

Modern-looking but retaining some of Times-like authority. Hint of architectural ogives.

Legibility/readability a priority, so nothing too radical.

Started with Liberation Serif 2, to get something like Times New Roman metrics for compatibility.
